Artificial Intelligence: 
> computers acting humanly / thinking humanly / thinking rationally / acting rationally -- [Russel and Norvig, 2003](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/1feg4j8/alma991019419529704436)

Machine Learning:
> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. -- [Tom Mitchell, 1997](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/1feg4j8/alma991003098569704436)

Deep Learning:

> specific learning technique based on neural networks


Note: Precise definitions are difficult to capture. Some simply describe AI as "everything that's hard in computer science".

# Neural Networks

![Diversity of neuronal morphologies in the auditory cortex](nervsys.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


Note: Artificial neural networks are inspired by how biological neural networks work ("groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons" with synapses forming connections)

From "Texture of the Nervous System of Man and the Vertebrates" by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit#/media/File:Cajal_actx_inter.jpg

----
## Artificial Neural Networks

Simulating biological neural networks of neurons (nodes) and synapses (connections), popularized in 60s and 70s

Basic building blocks: Artificial neurons, with $n$ inputs and one output; output is activated if at least $m$ inputs are active

![Simple computations with artificial neuron](neur_logic.svg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

(assuming at least two activated inputs needed to activate output)

----
## Threshold Logic Unit / Perceptron

computing weighted sum of inputs + step function

$z = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ... + w_n x_n = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{w}$

e.g., step: `$\phi$(z) = if (z<0) 0 else 1` 

![Perceptron](perceptron.svg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

----

![Perceptron](perceptron.svg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

<!-- split -->

$o_1 = \phi(b_{1}  +  w_{1,1} x_1 + w_{1,2} x_2)$
$o_2 = \phi(b_{2}  +  w_{2,1} x_1 + w_{2,2} x_2)$
$o_3 = \phi(b_{3}  +  w_{3,1} x_1 + w_{3,2} x_2)$

****
$f_{\mathbf{W},\mathbf{b}}(\mathbf{X})=\phi(\mathbf{W} \cdot \mathbf{X}+\mathbf{b})$

($\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are parameters of the model)

----
## Multiple Layers

![Multi Layer Perceptron](mlperceptron.svg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Note: Layers are fully connected here, but layers may have different numbers of neurons

----
$f_{\mathbf{W}_h,\mathbf{b}_h,\mathbf{W}_o,\mathbf{b}_o}(\mathbf{X})=\phi( \mathbf{W}_o \cdot \phi(\mathbf{W}_h \cdot \mathbf{X}+\mathbf{b}_h)+\mathbf{b}_o$

![Multi Layer Perceptron](mlperceptron.svg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

(matrix multiplications interleaved with step function)

----
## Learning Model Parameters (Backpropagation)

Intuition:
- Initialize all weights with random values
- Compute prediction, remembering all intermediate activations
- If output is not expected output (measuring error with a loss function), 
  + compute how much each connection contributed to the error on output layer
  + repeat computation on each lower layer
  + tweak weights a little toward the correct output (gradient descent)
- Continue training until weights stabilize

Works efficiently only for certain $\phi$, typically logistic function: $\phi(z)=1/(1+exp(-z))$ or ReLU: $\phi(z)=max(0,z)$.

----
## Deep Learning

* More layers
* Layers with different numbers of neurons 
* Different kinds of connections
  - fully connected (feed forward)
  - not fully connected (eg. convolutional networks)
  - keeping state (eg. recurrent neural networks)
  - skipping layers
  - ...

Note: Essentially the same with more layers and different kinds of architectures.


----
## On Terminology

* Deep learning: neural networks with many internal layers
* DNN architecture: network structure, how many layers, what connections, which $\phi$ (hyperparameters)
* Model parameters: weights associated with each input in each neuron


----
## Example Scenario

* MNIST Fashion dataset of 70k 28x28 grayscale pixel images, 10 output classes

![MNIST Fashion](fashion_mnist.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

----
## Example Scenario

* MNIST Fashion dataset of 70k 28x28 grayscale pixel images, 10 output classes
* 28x28 = 784 inputs in input layers (each 0..255)
* Example model with 3 layers, 300, 100, and 10 neurons

```python
model = keras.models.Sequential([
  keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),
  keras.layers.Dense(300, activation="relu"),
  keras.layers.Dense(100, activation="relu"),
  keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")
])
```

**How many parameters does this model have?**

## Example Scenario

* MNIST Fashion dataset of 70k 28x28 grayscale pixel images, 10 output classes
* 28x28 = 784 inputs in input layers (each 0..255)
* Example model with 3 layers, 300, 100, and 10 neurons

```python
model = keras.models.Sequential([
  keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),
  # 784*300+300 = 235500 parameter
  keras.layers.Dense(300, activation="relu"), 
  # 300*100+100 = 30100 parameters
  keras.layers.Dense(100, activation="relu"),
  # 100*10+10 = 1010 parameters
  keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")
])
```

Total of 266,610 parameters in this small example!

----
## Deep Learning Discussion

* Can approximate arbitrary functions
* Able to handle many input values (e.g., millions of pixels) 
* Internal layers may automatically recognize higher-level structures 
* Often used without explicit feature engineering
* Often huge number of parameters, expensive inference and training
* Often large training sets needed
* Too large and complex to understand what is learned, why, or how decisions are made (compare to decision trees)
